# BeFeel

Instructions
1. Download 'Expo Go' on your phone (login)
3. Download all the files (App.js is where we will be doing most of the changes)
4. Once it's downloaded run 'npx expo start' in the terminal of your complier (I use VSCode)
5. This should run a mini server that allows you to see the app from the web or from your phone
6. It should give you a QR code that you should scan and it will take you to Expo Go
7. You click on the project and you should be able to see the app
